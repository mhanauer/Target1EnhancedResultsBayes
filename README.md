################################################################################
### To run this program, please prepare your computer as follows.
### 1. Install the general-purpose programming language R from  
###      http://www.r-project.org/
###    Install the version of R appropriate for your computer's operating
###    system (Windows, MacOS, or Linux).   
### 2. Install the Bayesian MCMC sampling program JAGS from
###      http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/
###    Again, intall the version appropriate for your operating system.
### 3. Install the R editor, RStudio, from
###      http://rstudio.org/
###    This editor is not necessary, but highly recommended.
### 4. Make sure that the following programs are all
###    in the same folder as this file:
###      BESTexample.R (this file)
###      BEST.R
###      DBDA2E-utilities.R
###      BESTexamplePower.R 
### 5. Make sure that R's working directory is the folder in which those 
###    files reside. In RStudio, use menu tabs Tools -> Set Working Directory.
###    If working in R, use menu tabs File -> Change Dir.
### 6. After the above actions are accomplished, this program should
###    run as-is in R. You may "source" it to run the whole thing at once,
###    or, preferably, run lines one at a time in order.
